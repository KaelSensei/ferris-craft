## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial ferris-craft (Rust Skills — Minecraft Domain) skill set: root docs (`SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`) and `skills/` with 8 skill files (domain-minecraft, mc-01 through mc-07) for voxel/Minecraft-adjacent Rust systems.
- Main README banner image: `assets/rust-skills-minecraft-banner.png` (Rust Skills IA for Minecraft — in-game Rust companion), displayed at top of README.
- **mc-00-vibe** (Layer 0): New entry skill `skills/mc-00-vibe.md` for non-technical / vibe coders — translates "I want to make…", "my server is laggy", "where do I start" into the right technical skill. Includes plain-English goal table and starter project snippet.
